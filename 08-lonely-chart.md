## What are Lonely Charts?

- We start by looking at the worldwide child mortality table for all countries
  by year.
- Taking this dataset into excel and creating a generic chart out of it, we can
  get the visualization we need, but these charts are "lonely" since not a lot
  of people are compelled to look at them. That data is not conveyed in a way
  that appeals to wider audiences.
- As a DataViz engineer you have many mediums you can convey your message.

## How to get effective

- The Dataset is at the center of DataViz. But the data is not enough, you must
  also consider the story the data can tell

- A process to visualizing data can take the following form:

0. Assesing     - Asking questions about the dataset itself, and the audience
   that will consume it.
0. Planning     - Define a concept: find your message and structure it, Find
   some inspiration for visualizations and then sketch some ideas.
0. Building     - Choose tools to create and iterate over your design, this is
   where you start coding with frameworks such as svelte and d3.js.
0. Publishing   - Publish the data and collect feedback

## The emotions

- While structuring the story around the data can make the visualization
  appealing. there's still one piece missing, which is the emotions this data
  can evoke.
- To truly understand and make the audience to connect with the data we must try
  to convey the emotions behind the data.
- As humans we are not great at connecting with graphs and charts, due to
  psychic numbing.
- In contrast images bring emotions to the surface
- Data art can bring emotions to our visualizations in order to convey emotions.
- When your audience doesn't really want to play around with the diagrams, we
  can use "Scrollytelling" techniques to animate our data art and
  visualizations.

Each file in this repository contains notes for each of the linked talks. In
case I was too concentrated on the talk, the motes might be more sparse, however
each talk also has a link to the talk's video which is freely available online.

Included Images are screenshots captured from the published videos.

Please feel free to add to these notes by opening up a PR, any edits corrections
and requests are welcome.

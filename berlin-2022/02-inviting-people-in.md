# Inviting People In

By: Michelle Chin

- Diverse teams are great!
- Pre pandemic it was actually working well
- With the onset of the pandemic, collaboration took a bit of a hit from video
  fatigue
- Instant messaging wasn't really better, as it's too async
- These are walls that disrupt collaboration
- They hybrid model can be a bit of a hit and miss
- Ways to make the hybrid model work better
- The takeaways from this talk might seem ike too much work, but we'll strive to
  keep these todos concise.

## 1. Reflect on who you are

A nice way to do this is to use the positionality wheel and take an audit of who
you are as a person, but also who is in your team.

## 2. Identify perspectives you're missing

This can help you understand which people you want to invite to the team.

## 3. Quick fixes

- Usability testing: Test your site with users, but also people who's
  perspectives might be missing
- Ask for feedback: Getting feedback from other teams can provide a good set of
  perspectives your team might be missing.
- Hire a "full-perspective" team: while it takes a lot of effort and time, and
  possibly overkill, the value it provides is worth it!

## 4. Inviting People **In**

- Avoid signaling people out, especially based on their differences from you
- Similarly to a dinner party you can do a few things to make them feel welcome
  and engaged:
    - Pair them with a buddy
    - Politely identify any accommodations that might be needed
    - Converse: Act with curiosity, avoid dismissing ideas and be open to
      listening
    - Build a safe space to encourage contribution, help make people feel seen
      and ensure they have opportunities to communicate with colleagues
    - Foster psychological safety.
- Reflect on how you succeeded in building an inviting team
- The BRIDGE framework can help in this.

## 5. Start small, Try today

- Complete the positionality wheel
- Engage in conversation
- Take your time, and don't get discouraged

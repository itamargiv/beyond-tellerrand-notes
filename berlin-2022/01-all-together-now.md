# All Together Now

By: Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino []()

- A reflection: worked as an industrial designer around tech, and over the last
  2 years does climate work.

## Moral disengagement

- There's a lot of things going wrong in society now, these things have been
  around for a long time and this is perplexing.
- We can try to be active agents in our fields: There's a decision whether we
  engage with these problems in our work or not.
- These problems might be addressable with traditional design practice
- Our common go to is to try and address these problems with advertising, rather
  than improving infrastructure.
- Ecological work seems to be "Women's work", this ties into an odd sense of
  gender identity

## From New to Next Practice

- What does better mean? Better seems to be working on the same things but
  making them perceived as "better"
- Multitude of ideas are attempted, but they use the old language of "new" to
  try and convince stakeholders and investors, but essentially go nowhere
- Instead we should try to understand, what the "next" practice is, not
  re-wrapping the old in a "new" guise

- A way to do this is to find a way to make thing seem:
    - Simple - The information is available to people in a digestible form
    - Understandable - Make sure people understand their possibilities
    - Critical - Expose what various certifications mean, lack of standards

## How did we get here?

- The dominant model of attention is a lazy model
- Not everyone knows what attention is, we all have assumptions and ideas about
  what it is.

How did number of visitors metrics become the dominant model of attention?

- The first to use this model was utilized by google, which popularized these
  metrics in other digital companies.

Our sensibilities are used against us for profit.

- We focus user's attention in order to get them in our apps. But that is not
  nourishing them, since we interfere with how the normally focus.
- Unfortunately it's not just "for profit" companies that apply this, services
  like mastodon also embrace this type of model, since it's the prevalent one. 
- We have a scarcity mindset when it comes to information: We are hungry for
  information, and it is used against us to create some internal distraction. It
  puts us in a loop of trying to get as much information as we can.

Our digital habits are counterproductive by design

- Once we feel as if we can control our attention we get a better handle of our
  negative feelings.
- Interruptions are put in to applications by design, in order to prevent us
  from fully achieving our attention goals.
- This causes a number of responses that feed this cycle: 
  * Fight  - News over-reporting on social media, closing our accounts etc.
  * Flight - Attention deficit for any one app, having 20 tabs with various chat
             programs open 
  * Freeze - Binge watching netflix 
  * Fawn   - Refershing your emails constantly 

## What can we do now?

- Different business models: the creator economy can help mitigate this
  attention grabbing model that is promoted by advertisers.
- As end users and developers we can utilize technology fro before the
  algorithmic feeds.
- Utilize "Emotionally Intelligent Designs" 
- Prototype experiences of flow
- Build our own meta-verses with existing world building software and games.

## Where can we go?

- Maybes we can craft datasets that center on the human. 
- Attention can be thought of as a connection.
- If we model attention as lines in a drawing, we might be able to enable
  people. to log their own attention, or even observe on log other's attentions.
- We can model our own attention, and try to bring that into our interaction
  design.
- Allow yourself to be bored, otherwise it will be very boring
